Processions by opposition supporters were perceived by segments of the Malay community as provocative, worsening grievances and igniting the violence. In response, the king declared a state of emergency, suspended parliament, and handed civilian administration to the National Operations Council under Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak. Official sources cited 196 fatalities, though some scholars argue the real number was closer to 600. Thousands were injured or displaced.",

The festival includes Kavadi Aattam, a ceremonial act of sacrifice where devotees carry physical burdens to repay spiritual debts. Worshipers carry pots of milk as offerings and may pierce their skin, tongue, or cheeks with vel skewers. Preparation includes remaining clean, praying regularly, following a vegetarian diet, fasting, and staying celibate.
